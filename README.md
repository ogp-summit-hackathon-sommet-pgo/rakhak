OpenResponse is a web app tool which allows for strategists to create predictive scenarios for training based on previous data about disaster impacts. Users can input certain disasters, such as wild fires, avalanches, tsunamis and OpenResponse will simulate the impact on the transit efficiency, local GDP, EMS response times and more. Users can use this information to be prepared for the incoming shortages and allocate resources effectively.
