OpenResponse is a web app tool which allows for strategists to create predictive scenarios for training based on previous data about disaster impacts. OpenResponse will collect a set of inputs from the user, including (transit efficiency, local GDP, EMS response times) and apply the disaster simulation model to it. Using this simulation, strategists and first responders can work together to iron out the kinks in a disaster plan beforehand.
